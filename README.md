# OpenAIGym-Taxi-v2-env

In this repository you will find an algorithm that uses OpenAi gym's Taxi-v2 environment and creates a taxi 
agent that navigates a grid world. For the details of this environment see Section 3.1 of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9905014).

I have used Q-learning (Sarsamax) to update the state-value function. The best average reward returned by the algorithm is 9.423.
